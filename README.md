# 🎟️ Event Management Application — Northeastern University  
*A Project Management–Driven Mobile Application for Campus-Wide Event Coordination*  
**Course:** EMGT5220 – Engineering Project Management  
**Team:** Collective Solutions  

---

## 📌 Overview  
The **Event Management Application** is a centralized mobile platform designed to help Northeastern University students, clubs, and administrators streamline event discovery, creation, and coordination.

The system solves a major problem: event information is scattered across Instagram, emails, posters, and word-of-mouth. This app consolidates everything into a single, secure, mobile-first platform accessible on both iOS and Android.

This project follows a full **PMI-aligned project lifecycle**, including Work Breakdown Structure, RACI, risk analysis, budgeting, Agile execution, QA strategy, and compliance checks.
